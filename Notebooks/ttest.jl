# # T-test
#
# We often want to compare a treatment group to a control group
# to identify whether or not some response occured due to the treatment.
# An easy example is to compare the bodyweights of mice
# fed either a normal diet or a high fat diet.
#
# This example is taken from [Data Analysis for Life Scientists](https://leanpub.com/dataanalysisforthelifesciences)

# This shows what the weights of a population of normal femal mice

# Now let's look at an experiemtn with 24 mice,
# where 12 mice were fed normal chow,
# and the other 12 were given a high-fat diet.

# The mean of the high-fat group is clearly higher
# than the group fed normal chow.
# The question is: is this difference meaningful?
#
# Afterall, the weights substantilly overlap.
# In addition, the heaviest mouse in the highfat diet group
# is lighter than the heaviest mouse in the control population:

any(x -> x > maximum(hf), controls.Bodyweight)

# ... and about 25% of mice in the control population are heavier
# than the median high-fat diet-fed mouse.

count(x-> x > quantile(hf, .5), controls.Bodyweight) / nrow(controls)

# Of course, we usually don't have this large control population to compare to,
# but it's possible we just happened to get some particularly heavy mice
# in our high-fat group,
# or even some particularly light mice in our experimental control group.
#
# A t-test can be used to test the null hypothesis (hâ‚€) that the two groups
# are drawn from the same population.
